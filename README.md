# Manufacturing Data Analytics with Excel, SQL, Tableau & Power BI

This project focuses on end-to-end manufacturing data analytics using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to analyze production performance, quality metrics, machine costs, and buyer contribution.  
Interactive dashboards provide actionable insights into operational efficiency, rejection trends, cost optimization, and data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠️ Implementation Blueprint

### 🧹 Data Acquisition & Preparation
Manufacturing transactional data was collected and consolidated, covering:
- Production quantities  
- Rejected quantities  
- Machine costs  
- Operations & departments  
- Buyers & employees  
- Time periods  

Data cleaning and standardization were performed using Excel and SQL to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure accurate KPI calculations.

---

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed in-depth analysis to identify:
- Production trends  
- Rejection patterns  
- Cost drivers  
- Buyer performance  

EDA helped uncover seasonal variations, high-rejection operations, cost-intensive machines, and differences in buyer contribution and fulfillment efficiency.

---

### 📊 Interactive Dashboard Development
Developed interactive dashboards using Excel, Tableau, and Power BI with:
- Slicers and filters  
- Drill-down functionality  

Dashboards allow analysis by:
- Buyer  
- Department  
- Operation  
- Machine  
- Employee  
- Time period  

These views support both operational teams and executive decision-makers.

---

### 📈 Performance & Efficiency Metrics
Calculated and visualized key manufacturing KPIs, including:
- Production completion percentage  
- Rejection rate & defect rate  
- First Pass Yield (FPY)  
- Cost per unit & cost efficiency  
- Machine productivity  
- On-time delivery rate  
- Customer fulfillment rate  

These metrics help evaluate overall operational effectiveness.

---

### 🤖 Operational & Analytical Insights
Analyzed historical production and cost trends to identify:
- Performance bottlenecks  
- Process improvement opportunities  

Insights support better machine utilization, quality control, and cost reduction strategies.

---

### 🌍 Real-World Manufacturing Application
This project demonstrates how manufacturing organizations can:
- Monitor production efficiency  
- Reduce quality losses  
- Optimize machine utilization  
- Manage buyer demand  
- Improve profitability through BI-driven decision-making
